            <w:t>In the years after the Holocaust, survivors around the globe began compiling memorial books, one for each city and town. These literary monuments to destroyed communities preserved local stories and documented the names of victims to keep memory alive. As a historian of Eastern European Jewry, I have long appreciated the way these memorial books provide insight into the everyday rhythms of ordinary life. In them, contributors share anecdotes about the local schools, the fire brigade orchestra, the soccer club, the Zionist youth group. They paint portraits of local celebrities whose fame extended only as far as the wheat fields around the town: a favorite teacher, a respected rabbi, the town councilor, the water-porter everybody knew. They document events small and large: the time a Jewish soldier returned home from the Russo-Japanese War, the time a traveling theater troupe from Odesa came to town, the time a fire burned down Yankl Friedman’s inn, the day the Nazis arrived.</w:t>

A landscape of rolling fields beneath a city on a hill suggests the bucolic countryside around Proskuriv, with fields of flax and wheat and orchards of cherries and plums.

            <w:t xml:space="preserve">This was not the first wave of pogroms in the area, but its scope eclipsed previous bouts of violence in terms of the range of participants, the number of victims, and the depths of barbarity. Ukrainian peasants, Polish townsfolk, and Russian soldiers robbed their Jewish neighbors with impunity, stealing property they believed rightfully belonged to them. Armed militants, with the acquiescence and support of large segments of the population, tore out Jewish men’s beards, ripped apart Torah scrolls, raped Jewish girls and women, and, in many cases, tortured Jewish townsfolk before gathering them in market squares, marching them to the outskirts of town, and shooting them. On at least one occasion, insurgent fighters barricaded Jews in a synagogue and burned down the building. The largest of the anti-Jewish massacres left over a thousand people dead, but the vast majority were much smaller affairs: more than half the incidents resulted only in property damage, injury, and at most a few fatalities.

The lives of many more were shattered. Approximately six hundred thousand Jewish refugees were forced to flee across international borders, and millions more were displaced internally. About two-thirds of all Jewish houses and over half of all Jewish businesses in the region were looted or destroyed. The pogroms traumatized the affected communities for at least a generation, and set off alarms around the world.</w:t>

            <w:t>I had always thought that the Holocaust was simply inconceivable before it happened—that it was beyond the ability of humans to imagine, to predict, or to prepare for. My father, whose story of survival informed my early knowledge of the Holocaust, emphasized how “normal” everything seemed before. He lived an upper-middle-class life in Budapest, enjoying fencing lessons and family vacations at Lake Balaton, until the Nazi invasion of Hungary in March 1944. Likewise, the most famous victims of the Holocaust had their first encounters with genocidal antisemitism only several years into the war. Anne Frank went into hiding in July 1942, and the Gestapo discovered her secret annex in August 1944. Elie Wiesel reports that he first heard rumors of massacres as early as 1941, but it was not until May 1944 that he was deported to Auschwitz from the Sighetu Marma</w:t>

            <w:t>portrayals of the Holocaust similarly emphasize the suddenness and unexpectedness of what took place . When I bring my students to the Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills, Michigan, for instance, they enter the exhibition in a large open space filled with Jewish ritual objects and photos of everyday Jewish life in Europe, testifying to a vibrant, rooted existence. Then, turning a corner, they encounter a massive portrait of Adolf Hitler looming over a long hallway that descends into the next exhibit room. The impression is that Hitler appeared out of the blue, with no hint of the coming apocalypse.</w:t>

They fled the threatened region by the millions, radically altering the demography of world Jewry. They established far-reaching self-help and philanthropic organizations. They lobbied the Great Powers, pressing the newly established states of Poland and Romania to accept clauses guaranteeing the rights of minorities in their constitutions. They colonized new lands, setting the groundwork for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine. They memorialized the pogroms in elegies and art.

Demagogic propagandists and pamphleteers stoked fears that the newcomers could be closet Bolsheviks, igniting a worldwide red scare and paving the way for the rise of right-wing political movements. Governments responded by issuing new border regulations; Romania, Hungary, Poland, Germany, the United States, Argentina, and British Palestine—the countries to which the largest numbers of Jewish refugees were fleeing—each revised their immigration policies to foreclose further Jewish immigration and to insulate themselves from the Bolshevik menace.</w:t>

In Austrian Galicia, the socialist writer Ivan Franko wrote popular stories about hard-working Ukrainian oil workers who are cheated by their Jewish bosses. The image of indolent Jews exploiting the labor of the peasantry and mocking Christianity were tried and true tropes in Slavic folklore. A popular myth told of Jews holding church keys or other holy objects as pledges. Jewish estate managers and moneylenders were accused of impoverishing the peasants by issuing them credit they could never repay, and Jewish tavernkeepers were blamed for peasant drunkenness. But, most of all, Jews were simply baffling to regular churchgoers, who wondered why they adhered to such bizarre practices and why they obstinately rejected the truth of Gospel.</w:t>

            <w:t>Nevertheless, in ordinary times, relations between Jews and Christians were peaceable, sometimes even amicable. Peasant farmers would ride their cart into town to have their wheat ground in a Jewish-owned mill or to have the sugar extracted from their beets in a Jewish-owned factory. They would sell the flour and sugar to Jewish traders who brought it to market, and, while in town, would pick up some dry goods from the Jewish shops, and perhaps stop by the Jewish blacksmith to have their horse’s hooves reshod or a kitchen implement repaired. The Jewish cobblers, tailors, coopers, glaziers, and small-shop owners clustered around the market square and the muddy streets leading into it, while Ukrainian townsfolk tended to live farther out, closer to the fields, orchards, and pastures. In the east, Jews shared the urban space with Russian bureaucrats and military personnel garrisoned in town; in the west, they shared it with Polish nobles, many of whom were impoverished despite their aristocratic titles. The growth of large factories in the first years of the new century also attracted growing numbers of Ukrainians to the cities; they labored there alongside their Jewish coworkers, then often returned to their villages in the summers to help with the seasonal farm labor.</w:t>

            <w:t>However, the construction of railways and the development of soap, tallow, and leather factories transformed the crumbling market towns and regional administrative centers along the rails into bustling cities, and created a new class of wealthy Jewish manufacturers. By the turn of the century, tobacco and sugar beet factories were emerging all around Kyiv Province, many of them named after their Jewish owners: Kogan, Rotenberg, Shishman. The growing disparity between town and country energized a revolutionary movement, which sprouted among the urban intellectuals and factory workers and quickly spread to the rural masses. The Great War intensified the growing unrest by destroying harvests, demoralizing villages, and destabilizing families. But it was the revolutionaries’ promise of a postwar redistribution of the land from the predominantly Polish nobles who owned it to the Ukrainian peasants who farmed it that most excited the countryside.</w:t>

But Jewish civilians alone were singled out for persecution by virtually everyone.

The first provides background, focusing on the history of anti-Jewish violence in the Russian empire and the impact of the Great War, including the treatment of Jews during the Russian occupation of Eastern Galicia and the mass expulsions of Jews from the war zone. It then looks at the revolutions of 1917 in Russia, the establishment of Ukrainian statehood (with its promise of autonomy for all national minorities), and the Bolsheviks’ negotiations to end the war.

            <w:t>The second part offers a detailed examination of some of the 167 documented pogroms that took place during the first three months of 1919 in the provinces of Volhynia and Podilia. In these pogroms, militias acting as part of the army of the Ukrainian People’s Republic initiated or authorized attacks on Jewish civilians. The pretext for each episode was an allegation or rumors that the Jews were planning an uprising to install a Bolshevik government. But the military leaders were also motivated by a desire for loot, which they believed Jews were hoarding in their workplaces and homes. Once the veneer of public order was breached, ordinary citizens joined in the plunder and the city grew habituated to anti-Jewish violence. In the aftermath, Jewish aid workers initiated a campaign to document the violence for posterity, collecting testimonies in the hope of eventually prosecuting the guilty parties.</w:t>

            <w:t>By April 1919, the Ukrainian People’s Republic had mostly been defeated by the Bolshevik Red Army. However, large pockets of the region were controlled by insurgent warlords who moved into the power vacuum. Motivated by greed and the lust for power, they terrorized the Jewish populations in their midst. The third part of the book looks at some of the 307 documented pogroms unleashed by these warlords, as anti-Jewish violence spread throughout the region and peasants turned against their Jewish neighbors with pitchforks and machine guns. This section then draws upon memoir literature to look at the town of Slovechno, which produced its own local warlord who turned neighbor against neighbor.</w:t>

After years of intense violence in the town of Tetiiv, for instance, armed peasants forced the local Jews into the synagogue and burned it to the ground. In their final bid for military supremacy in the region, the Bolsheviks contended with a Polish invasion before battling their way back to the gates of Warsaw thanks in large part to the efforts of the famed Red Cavalry. Once again, this section demonstrates how the general tolerance for violence escalated with each episode, until the Bolsheviks were finally able to secure control over the region, gain a monopoly on the use of force, and put a stop to the pogroms.</w:t>

All this intensified animosity toward the new government and toward the Jews, who were blamed for its excesses. The concluding chapter examines the pogroms the Germans instigated when they invaded in June 1941, showing how the Nazis exploited local memory and drew upon existing patterns of violence when they initiated a new and final round of slaughter.</w:t>

            <w:t>The riots to which the paper was referring first broke out in a tavern in Elizavetgrad (now Kropyvnytskyi, Ukraine) during Easter week of 1881. Easter had long been a perilous time for Jews: reminded of the role the ancient Pharisees had played in the crucifixion of Jesus, and offended by the continued Jewish presence in their midst, churchgoers occasionally assaulted their Jewish neighbors. But this time the unrest was precipitated by the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, who had been killed a month earlier by revolutionary terrorists, at least one of whom was revealed to have had a Jewish background.</w:t>

Spurred again by rumors of a missing child, Christian townsfolk attacked Jews and charged them with having murdered the child for ritual purposes. This time they were met with resistance: in the aftermath of the Kishinev pogrom, and inspired in part by the Hebrew writer Hayyim Nahman Bialik’s poem “In the City of Slaughter,” Zionist youth and Jewish socialist activists had concluded that passivity in the face of violence invited further violence.</w:t>

            <w:t>unrest threatened the very foundations of the tsarist empire. Beginning in January 1905, worker strikes, military mutinies, and peasant uprisings paralyzed the economy. Several illegal Marxist-inspired political parties that had formed clandestinely in the last years of the nineteenth century each aspired to direct the popular discontent into a political revolution. The Socialist Revolutionaries tried to rouse the peasantry with promises of seizing nobles’ land and delivering it into the hands of those who toiled on it; Vladimir Lenin’s Bolsheviks, meanwhile, focused their attention on organizing the urban proletariat. As it turned out, the sectors of the population most receptive to such revolutionary calls were ethnic minorities who had been oppressed by the tsar, the Jews most of all. The largest of the revolutionary parties, in fact, was the General Union of Jewish Workers in Lithuania, Poland, and Russia, better known as the Bund, which advocated both for a socialist redistribution of resources and for national minority rights, particularly the right to use the Yiddish language for education and cultural development.</w:t>

            <w:t xml:space="preserve"> The Black Hundreds were responsible for inciting many of the violent clashes with Jews that punctuated the politicized and chaotic atmosphere of the summer of 1905. Some of these episodes were perpetrated by tsarist loyalists riled up by the right-wing and antisemitic press; others by traveling thugs, intent on roughing up their targets and making off with stolen booze and valuables; still others by disaffected workers simply lashing out against war shortages and acting in the heat of the moment. They were manifestations of popular discontent, premodern ethnic riots fused with criminality. The state tolerated a limited amount of bloodshed as a means of releasing pent-up frustrations, but when the riots got out of hand the police would intervene to put them down and restore equilibrium.</w:t>

They fired warning shots into the air, sending the peasant boys running into town shouting that Jews were shooting at them.

The next day, word of the incident spread, leading to further marketplace riots, gunfights that pitted the self-defense brigade against the police and the military, and the death of twenty-one Jews. “Zhytomyr looked like a graveyard after the pogrom,” according to one account.</w:t>

The self-defense brigade acquiesced to their co-religionists’ anxieties. But as soon as they disarmed, the townsfolk fell upon them with swords, axes, and clubs. Seven members of the brigade were killed in the melee, while a pair managed to hide in the synagogue.

The prominent Jewish presence in the conquered region unnerved the Russian soldiers. They were mistrustful of their own Jewish comrades, whose knowledge of Yiddish made them easy conversation partners for the Galician Jews; unit commanders complained that their Jewish infantrymen seemed to have more in common with the Galicians than with their fellow soldiers. The military brass worried about Jews fraternizing with the enemy, deserting their units, and betraying Russian military secrets. Because Yiddish and German are closely related, Jewish soldiers in the Russian army were often tapped as interpreters.

Officers gave free rein to their troops in Jewish neighborhoods, permitting them to plunder as a reward for their conquests. Soldiers torched the largely Jewish market towns along the border, on the false pretext that Jews were aiding the enemy and shooting from their windows at the Russian soldiers. In 1914 alone, Russian troops killed eighteen Jews in Lviv, eighteen Jews in Brody, and more than one hundred and fifty Jews in Jarosław.

Emboldened by the prospect of redrawing borders in a postwar world, Ukrainians and Poles began planning for eventual statehood in overlapping territories. Polish nationalists envisioned a republic that would replicate the historic borders of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth by reuniting the Kingdom of Poland with Austrian Galicia and the western provinces of the Russian Empire that made up the Pale of Settlement. Ukrainians, meanwhile, dreamed of a state that would encompass the large Ukrainian-speaking populations of Eastern Galicia as well as Russia’s southwestern provinces, encompassing most of the southern half of the Pale of Settlement. The Germans, for their part, plotted to undermine Russian rule from within: they promised the Ukrainians support for statehood and secretly channeled funds to revolutionaries who sought to overthrow the tsar. The French, on the other hand, permitted Polish Legionnaires to train in France in expectation of eventual Polish statehood, which would serve as a bulwark </w:t>

The revolution provided the opportunity for these nationalists to move from the university to the state house. Two weeks after the tsar was deposed, the Ukrainian socialist parties formed a governing entity, the Central Rada (council)—modeled on the soviets—to serve as a coordinating body for Ukrainian workers, peasants, and soldiers. Within a month, the Rada organized an All-Ukrainian National Congress of 1,500 delegates, who elected 150 members to serve in the Central Rada. The eminent historian Mykhailo Hrushevsky was elected its leader, and the writer Volodymyr Vynnychenko, who became his second-in-command, was tasked with the crucial job of negotiating with the Russian Provisional Government.</w:t>

Both Hrushevsky and Vynnychenko had spent time in tsarist prisons for their involvement in revolutionary movements, a rite of passage for most liberal and freethinking writers of the time. Politically, they shared a strong commitment to the multinational character of the region, and advocated for broad autonomy for the national minorities—Jews, Poles, and Germans. Each of these, they believed, should have the right to use their own language, worship according to their own faith, educate their children in their own schools, and receive proportional representation in national political bodies.</w:t>

The position of Secretary of Military Affairs went to the journalist Symon Petliura. Born into a modest peasant family—his father was a coachman—and educated in an Orthodox preparatory school to become a priest, Petliura was an odd choice for the job of military commander. After abandoning the religious path, he had joined the Ukrainian Social Democratic Workers’ Party and moved around as an itinerant intellectual: to Tiflis (today’s Tbilisi), Ekaterinodar (Krasnodar), St. Petersburg, Lviv, and Moscow, taking various office jobs and editing newspapers.

In May 1917, units representing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers serving in the former tsarist army declared their loyalty to him, an achievement all the more impressive since the majority of Ukrainians were serving far from Ukraine. The socialists in the Rada opposed the notion of a conscripted army, which they saw as a glorification of imperialist militarism, and preferred to rely upon a volunteer force. As a result, at his most powerful Petliura fielded a force of only about 150,000 poorly trained and ill-equipped soldiers.</w:t>

            <w:t>When negotiations ended at an impasse, the Rada issued its “Second Universal,” declaring its aspiration to become the “sole supreme body of revolutionary democracy in Ukraine” in coordination with all the nationalities living in its territory. While the First Universal had been addressed to “the Ukrainian People,” the Second Universal was addressed to “citizens of the Ukrainian Land,” expressly recognizing Ukraine as a multinational territory. The Central Rada agreed to expand from 150 to more than 800 seats, to reserve nearly a third of those seats for representatives from the national minorities (Russians, Jews, and Poles), and to create new vice-secretariats for each nationality within the cabinet. (The position would eventually be upgraded to general secretary, and in January 1918 renamed to minister.) These moves were not only meant to gain the political loyalty of the minorities, but also reflect the genuinely tolerant ethos of the Ukrainian socialist leadership. “Without them,” Vynnychenko declared of the national minorities, “we could not consider ourselves the government of the whole population.”</w:t>

According to the statute, elected representatives of Jewish communities would be responsible for keeping records of births, deaths, and marriages, maintaining cemeteries, organizing loan associations, providing representatives to state and local governments, and supporting Jewish schools, hospitals, nursing homes, orphanages, and other educational, welfare, and health institutions.

They even garnered the financial support of wealthy Jewish elites, who saw them as the surest guardians of private property rights. The White officers in charge of the Volunteer Army, as the Army of South Russia came to be known, were so confident of success that they refused to build alliances with any of the more liberal political parties; instead, they sought support from the Entente powers, the tsar’s former allies of Britain and France, with whom they formed close partnerships.

Trotsky shattered the delicate rapport that had been established between the negotiating teams. He immediately announced that the Russian delegation would no longer dine with the rest of the group or socialize outside of the negotiating table. “I decided to put an immediate stop to the familiarity that had quite imperceptibly been established during the early stages,” he explained in his autobiography.</w:t>

            <w:t>The Ukrainian question dominated the second session of the negotiations.

            <w:t>Realizing that the Bolshevik declaration of support for national self-determination meant little in practice, the Ukrainians turned to the Central Powers for support. Both needed a deal. The war had exhausted the Austrian and German homefronts, leaving their cities hungry and demoralized. The Austrians knew that only a fresh food supply would forestall the growing revolutionary movement at home. In exchange for black earth grain, they were willing to support Ukrainian independence in the former Russian provinces so long as it didn’t excite the Ukrainians in Austrian Galicia. Meanwhile, with the Reds in control of Kharkiv and approaching Kyiv, the Ukrainian Central Rada was facing an existential threat they could only survive with the help of the Central Powers. Trotsky’s goal, on the other hand, was to stall for as long as possible—waiting for Bolshevik soldiers to take Kyiv and the revolution to take Vienna.</w:t>

Shiller, meanwhile, was staying at an inn occupied entirely by officers when the city came under attack. “A hail of bullets rained into the windows” as he and the others began to search for an escape route. They tied together sheets and towels, rappelled from a third-floor window into the backyard, then crawled into neighboring cellars. In these cramped quarters, Shiller managed to convince a soldier who was also in hiding to exchange coats and caps. Shiller justified his action: “My officer’s uniform could do him no harm, as his face was so unintelligent that even a blind man could detect the peasant in him.” Shiller was captured and held for two days in a school room; periodically, the Red Guards would take groups of officers and shoot them in the yard.

The Central Powers, for their part, had gotten what they wanted from Ukraine and had little incentive to make concessions to Trotsky. The terms they offered required the Bolshevik government to relinquish its claim to nearly 500,000 square miles of territory in the western and southern borderlands of the former Russian Empire, inhabited by over 50 million people. The Bolsheviks would be compelled to formally cede Lithuania and the former Kingdom of Poland, and to recognize the independence of Finland and Ukraine. Having little choice, on March 3 the Bolshevik delegation at Brest-Litovsk signed the humiliating peace treaty—according to Trotsky,</w:t>

            <w:t>On April 24, 1918, Abraham Dobryi, the Jewish director of the Kyiv branch of the Russian Foreign Trading Bank, was kidnapped from his nine-room apartment in one of Kyiv’s most ornate residences. Dobryi’s kidnappers drove the banker by automobile to the railway station and placed him under guard on a train heading to Kharkiv. There he was held at the Grand Hotel for four days, until he was able to bribe his guards and secure his release.</w:t>

            <w:t xml:space="preserve">Dobryi had made his personal fortune dealing in sugar, one of the region’s most lucrative resources. The area around Kyiv was blessed with dry and sunny weather that yielded beetroot with the high saccharine content valued by dealers, and after Russia joined the Brussels Sugar Convention in 1907 the sugar industry took off, stimulated by the reduction in tariffs. But the market was risky, as early frosts or wet summers could decimate the delicate harvest, and the cost of maintaining technologically advanced refineries and transporting the goods was high. Individual proprietors were heavily mortgaged, and after the poor harvest of 1912 a small coterie of predominantly Jewish “sugar barons” began buying up factories and refineries with loans from foreign banks. </w:t>

            <w:t xml:space="preserve"> When war conditions sent the price of sugar skyrocketing in 1916, the press accused the Jewish sugar barons of war profiteering. Dobryi, whose bank was heavily involved in the industry and who himself received financing from Deutsche Bank, was arrested at one point on charges of price speculation and illegal monopolistic practices. He was able to shake off the accusations and returned to his philanthropic and business pursuits.</w:t>

            <w:t>It turned out that Dobryi’s kidnapping had actually been coordinated by several of the Ukrainian government’s own ministers.

            <w:t>On the afternoon of April 28, the Central Rada held a stormy session to determine its response. Accusations of collaboration with the Germans were flying, and many members questioned the decision to have signed the peace treaty altogether. Moyshe Rafes, a representative of the Jewish Socialist Bund who had advocated a closer relationship with Bolshevik Russia, had just begun to speak when a German lieutenant barged into the chamber and announced that the entire government was under arrest. German soldiers had surrounded the building and were streaming into the Rada chambers. The lieutenant ordered the members of the government to hand over their weapons on pain of death. One after another, the parliamentarians solemnly walked up to the front of the chamber and placed their revolvers on the presidium table. German soldiers questioned every member of parliament and detained those they suspected of involvement in the Dobryi kidnapping plot.</w:t>

The illustrious crowd, which filled the huge hall to the outer stands, applauded when speaker after speaker called for the restoration of a strong authority and the appointment of a new chief of Ukraine. “We need a strong power, we need a dictator, we need a Hetman in accordance with our old custom,” they declared, using a variation of the traditional Cossack honorific.</w:t>

            <w:t>The spate of terror attacks continued the next month in Moscow and Petrograd, now aimed at the Bolsheviks. Once again, many blamed the Jews for the unrest, an accusation made tenable by the prominence of several individual Jews in separate incidents. On August 30, 1918, twenty-eight-year-old Fanny Kaplan fired three poison-tipped bullets at Lenin as he was leaving a Moscow factory; one bullet passed cleanly through his coat, the others lodged themselves in his shoulder and collarbone. The Bolshevik leader, she asserted during her interrogation, had been a “traitor to the revolution.” The same day, the anti-Bolshevik activist Leonid Kannegisser successfully assassinated the head of the secret police in Petrograd, Moisei Uritsky, shooting him in the head before fleeing on a bicycle. Kaplan acted because she thought the revolution had not gone far enough; Kannegisser, a defender of the Provisional Government and son of a wealthy shipyard owner, had been opposed to the revolution from the beginning. Although the two terrorists were motivated by very different political perspectives, many observers noted that both were born in Ukraine to Jewish families. Ironically, Uritsky, the assassinated secret police chief, shared this background as well.</w:t>

The capital of Austrian Galicia, Lviv had been transformed by the oil boom of the fin de siècle from a provincial administrative center into a metropolitan hub; the grand neoclassical “Habsburg yellow” government buildings around the Renaissance market square and amidst the baroque churches reflected the city’s growing political importance. Lviv drew comparisons with Vienna for its broad avenues and clean, modern urban center. The people, as well, had come to value Habsburg orderliness. More organized than their counterparts in Kyiv and with disciplined Austrian-trained soldiers behind them, Ukrainians in Galicia were convinced that a government in Lviv would succeed in defending Ukrainian sovereignty where the Central Rada and the Hetmanate had failed.</w:t>

            <w:t>Defeated by the Poles in Lviv, the West Ukrainian People’s Republic still managed to retain control of much of Eastern Galicia, including the oil fields. But the Galician dream of spearheading a large Ukrainian state was in tatters. In Kyiv, on the other hand, where the Hetmanate formally remained in power, but without the German backing that had sustained it, left-leaning Ukrainian nationalists saw renewed opportunities for statehood. Under the leadership of Volodymyr Vynnychenko, in November 1918 the remnants of the Central Rada regrouped in the town of Bila Tserkva, south of Kyiv, and formed a Directory—a name borrowed from the committee that governed France during its revolution—in order to restore the Ukrainian People’s Republic. Bulgakov mocked them as “men possessing the talent of turning up at the right time.”</w:t>

            <w:t>On December 12, the members of the Directory boarded a train to Kyiv. At every stop along the way, the ministers were greeted by crowds of cheering people, patriotic music, and laudatory speeches celebrating their return. In Kyiv, posters on lampposts announced the restoration of the Ukrainian People’s Republic and ordered all public signs in the predominantly Russian-speaking city to be in Ukrainian. Ladders appeared along the main streets as shopkeepers replaced their shingles—sometimes just taping paper signs in Ukrainian over the Russian-language metal letters, under the assumption that the new government would be short-lived.</w:t>

A good pair of winter boots took an expert craftsman fourteen to sixteen hours to make and used about three times as much leather as an ordinary shoe. The best ones came from the Ukrainian north: unlike in warmer climates, where insects would bore their way into the hides, producing a pitted leather, the hides in the cold north made for a smoother-grained leather that could easily hold a stain.

            <w:t>In an interview just before his hundredth birthday, in 2003, Veniamin Feldman recalled how the fur had to be worked into the soft leather around the vamp and quarter of the insole and how the outer sole had to be hammered onto the boot. Feldman, who was born in the village of Yanova Rudnya, about twelve miles from the town of Ovruch, in northern Volhynia, explained that in his youth a cobbler would come to his village to sew boots for anybody who provided their own leather and fur.</w:t>

            <w:t>One day in January 1919, a man who had been a warrant officer in the tsarist army and now led a local band of anti-Bolshevik fighters showed up at Feldman’s house and demanded leather for boots. Feldman’s father sent the officer away, retorting that he didn’t even have enough leather to make boots for his own family, let alone any to spare. That evening, Feldman recalls, the warrant officer returned along with other men. “They dressed my father in a winter coat with boots and all, took him into the woods and killed him. They took away his boots and left.”</w:t>

            <w:t>Kyiv until after Kozyr-Zirka had left, and when government officials did get word of the pogrom, they assumed it was of the same genre as the sporadic outbursts that had been occurring over the past year: unruly soldiers and peasants looting Jewish shops or robbing Jewish travelers. Such looting and robberies had occasionally resulted in fatalities, but they were few and far between. While the Red Army had massacred dozens of Jews in its battles against the bourgeois class and Polish troops had committed atrocities in the battle for Galicia, nobody in the multinational Ukrainian government imagined that one of their own would be terrorizing and killing innocent citizens under the banner of the Directory.</w:t>

            <w:t>The problem was that although Kozyr-Zirka and his forces were nominally fighting on behalf of the Directory, in reality the government had little control over events in Ovruch, leaving the otaman to behave with impunity. Revutsky, who was in the process of negotiating his appointment to Minister of Jewish Affairs at the time, wrote: “the Ovruch pogrom did not make as strong an impression in Kyiv as did later pogroms, such as those in Berdychiv and Zhytomyr. It occurred in a remote location at the front, where the authority of the regime existed mostly in name only. The ‘hero’ of the pogrom, Otaman Kozyr-Zirka, was a shady person; people weren’t even sure in which military he served.” Margolin echoed Revutsky: “It was impossible even to find out whether the government’s orders were obeyed in places farther than a few miles from the seat of the government.”</w:t>

After the German retreat, the army largely disintegrated, as the peasant fighters lost their incentive.

            <w:t>At about six in the morning on Wednesday, January 8, City Councilor Konstantin Novikov received a phone call from Deputy Mayor S. I. Ivantsky, summoning him immediately to City Hall. On his way he noticed that many stores on Gogolskaya, Mikhailovskaya, and Bolshaya Berdichevskaya streets had been ransacked. The unruly local soldiers that Vykidanets had observed the night before were still there. They had been looting all night. “There were a number of soldiers hanging around the emptied stores,” Novikov remembered. “There were also a number of women townsfolk with them, often carrying handbags or baskets. The thieves appeared to be very calm, and took their time picking out the goods they intended to steal. Several of them even took the time to try on hats.”</w:t>

On one street corner, they noticed a group of soldiers wearing papakha hats with a red silk ribbon flowing off the back. It was a type of headgear designed to emulate the Cossacks, but the soldiers wearing them did not seem to be Cossacks—they were ordinary soldiers, most of whom had fought in the tsarist military and now joined up with Petliura’s army. Novikov had not seen this type of headgear in town before. He knew immediately that these were not soldiers from the local garrison, but the troops dispatched by the Directory to put down the rebellion.</w:t>

One was wearing a military uniform and began to shout orders while the other one directed the looters, placing handfuls of goods in his car. Soon, more men wearing papakhas with red ribbons arrived on horseback and took over. The leader of the new group watched menacingly from the middle of Sobornaya Square as the looting spread around him.

            <w:t>soldiers in uniform stood by. A young boy in the street glanced up and caught Gorlovsky’s eye. The boy broke off from the crowd and ran to one of the soldiers, pointing up at the window. Before Gorlovsky realized what was going on, he heard a shot and felt as if something had hit him in the head. He took off his hat and saw that the bullet had gone right through it. His scalp was untouched. A few minutes later, six soldiers armed with rifles, revolvers, and bayonets were at the apartment door. They falsely claimed that a sniper had fired at them from the window, searched the apartment, stole cash and half a pound of tea, and left with a warning: if anybody should dare to step foot out of the apartment in the next two days, they would be shot. When Gorlovsky told his story to an investigator with the Legal Bureau of the Committee for Relief of Pogrom Victims, he brought along the bullet-pierced hat as evidence.</w:t>

            <w:t>Many witnesses noted that only Jewish-owned stores were robbed. Christian merchants knew to draw white crosses on their doors, display their icons, or simply attach notes to their doors indicating that the owners were Christian. Some Jews had a similar idea, saving their stores by drawing crosses on them.</w:t>

            <w:t>Soldiers filled their trucks and carts with pilfered goods, and took them in convoys to the station. What they didn’t want for themselves they sold to the highest bidder, or just tossed into the street for others to scavenge. The first civilians to take to the streets were local women who scooped up the goods left behind. Soon, crowds gathered around to wait their turn. Excited children ran alongside the soldiers, who playfully tossed them stolen treats. As the day turned into a festive free-for-all, ordinary city folk, including even members of the civil service and polite society, joined in.

At six in the evening, seven or eight armed men appeared at his apartment, claiming to have heard the sound of sniper fire coming from the window. They rummaged through his home in search of weapons to no avail. (Azhorsky had already turned over his revolver in accordance with Vozny’s directive to disarm the civilian population.) When the search was finished, one of the men sat down at the piano “and played a few chords.” The musician noticed that the notes were dull, as though something was dampening the hammers. He lifted the lid and found a silver-embroidered bag with diamond earrings, a gold watch, a gold bracelet, diamond rings, a silver wallet, and cash.</w:t>

Anyone who knew the secret hiding places, had keys to the storehouses, or had simply eyed some valuables while performing their duties got in on the action, robbing from their employers with abandon. Many wealthy members of the largely Jewish bourgeoisie in town employed domestics and laborers from the villages, some of whom resented the economic differential they observed between town and country, Jew and Christian. Even the less affluent often relied upon a “Shabbes goy,” a Christian helper, to perform many of the menial duties religious Jews refrained from on the Sabbath.

He had spent Orthodox Christmas day, January 7, on his family farmstead, a few miles outside of Zhytomyr. The next day, he went into town to meet up with some schoolmates and check out the action. He explained that he was drawn toward the gunfire on Bolshaya Berdichevskaya and Kievskaya streets because “I am a generally curious person, and I always go where something is happening.”</w:t>

But by two o’clock in the afternoon he had not returned, and word of the pogrom was already spreading. His wife, Khana, began to panic and ran to the synagogue to see what was going on. Nobody at the synagogue, though, had seen Moyshe that day. It became clear that Moyshe never made it to prayers.

The soldiers went to exceptional lengths to squeeze out more profit by holding members of high society for ransom, or forcing them to withdraw their savings from the banks. They turned their attention particularly to the wealthy Jewish estate-holders. At around four in the afternoon, a group of thirty to forty armed men wearing the papakhas and red ribbons of Palienko’s battalion found their way through a break in the fence into the courtyard of 3 Teatralnaya Street, where thirty-eight wealthy Jewish families had been able to lock the gates and hold off the soldiers for most of the pogrom. Now the soldiers gathered the residents together in one apartment, interrogated them, and conducted a full search of the building on the trumped-up charge that machine gun fire had come from inside.

            <w:t>At the station, the Teatralnaya Street prisoners were handed over to a man in his mid-thirties wearing a black peacoat and a papakha. They noticed that they were not the only captives: about three dozen other wealthy members of the Jewish community had been assembled as well, including the secretary of the city government. One soldier ordered everyone to undress down to their undershirts and hand over all their goods. Other soldiers began to beat the group with fists, clubs, shovels, and rifle butts. Nakhman Lyubarsky reported that he passed out from the beating. When he came to, his coat, wallet, and identification papers were gone, and he was left with only his overcoat, covered in blood. He felt a keen pain and realized he had been stabbed.</w:t>

            <w:t>Critics contended that Vozny egregiously allowed the pogrom perpetrators to remain on the loose.

            <w:t>It was clear that Vozny had little interest in bringing the perpetrators to justice.

Witnesses were particularly disappointed that the more respectable members of society, the urban intelligentsia, had neglected to defend the Jewish community.

            <w:t>The committee of inquiry sought to portray the pogrom in Zhytomyr as a replay of the one in Ovruch: both sanctioned by an overzealous military commander acting under the authority of the Directory government, but without approval from his superiors. This narrative—a pair of unruly officers taking advantage of the chaotic situation on the ground to enrich themselves—provided the ruling regime with a convenient way to deflect responsibility. It was in their interest to avoid the type of punitive actions that a full accounting of responsibility would have required, and to pin the blame exclusively on one individual. Many Jewish activists were also satisfied with these explanations, which provided a type of closure. In both pogroms, though, the Directory authorities were also to blame. By failing to properly equip and feed their army, they required the soldiers to pilfer from the local population. More important, they failed to send a clear message that violence against Jewish civilians would not be tolerated.</w:t>

            <w:t>The French psychologist Gustave LeBon, one of the founders of the study of group psychology, wrote in 1895 about the characteristics of crowds. In a large group, he posited, individuals become part of “a sort of collective mind which makes them feel, think, and act in a manner quite different from that in which each individual of them would feel, think, and act were he in a state of isolation.” A generation later, in 1921, Sigmund Freud challenged LeBon’s analysis, expressing doubt that new personalities could suddenly appear ex nihilo. Instead, Freud proposed, the seemingly uncharacteristic ways in which individuals behave as part of a crowd are actually already embedded within the individual, but are usually repressed. In a crowd, he wrote, “the individual is brought under conditions which allow him to throw off the repressions of his unconscious instincts.”</w:t>

            <w:t>Decades later, both these arguments were challenged by the American sociologist Mark Granovetter, who questioned the notion that the kind of sudden changes in people’s behavior observed in riots resulted either from the emergence of new norms and beliefs, or from the stripping away of the veneer of civilization. Instead, Granovetter took as his starting point the idea that the “cost to an individual of joining a riot declines as riot size increases.” Each individual, he suggested, has his or her own threshold for joining a riot, a point at which the costs of staying out of the riot exceed the costs of participating. Some are instigators, and will be the first to smash windows; others will join only if it seems that everybody else is doing so.</w:t>

            <w:t>This theory seems to best explain the dynamics of the Zhytomyr pogrom. The pogrom began with local soldiers garrisoned in the city, taking advantage of the revolutionary disorder to take what they believed was their due from the predominantly Jewish urban elites. But as the days went on, the circle of those partaking in the riot widened. Once the soldiers breached military discipline and began to loot Jewish property, local townswomen and children—those least likely to suffer negative consequences—joined in as well. Eventually, otherwise respectable members of Christian society—the dvorniks and the milkladies—calculated that the costs of staying out surpassed the costs of participating, and they too joined in the looting, risking their jobs and their communal status for fear of losing out on the spoils.</w:t>

            <w:t>Why was the riot directed specifically against Jews? The main reason seems to be that they were believed to hold the wealth in the city. Although Palienko’s soldiers were officially dispatched to stamp out the soviet’s uprising, and there are several reports of Jews being derided as Bolsheviks, there is little indication that rioters in this case were motivated primarily by anti-Bolshevik sentiment. In fact, the worst of the violence was directed against the wealthy bourgeoisie—the segment of the population least likely to be sympathetic to Bolshevism. The pogrom provided an opportunity for hungry peasants and soldiers, as well as workers and students, to acquire food and money from the privileged classes. As in the case of many riots, it was also about giving the upper classes their comeuppance. It was an act of leveling. But what could have been an ordinary bread riot became instead a deadly ethnic riot, because the rioters equated the Jews with the urban bourgeoisie. The charge of Bolshevism was just a pretext.</w:t>

About half of the newcomers were workers, flocking to the sugar, candle, brick, and tobacco factories, the iron foundry, or the breweries and mineral-water bottling plants. (Solomon Barak’s bottled mineral water was all the rage at the turn of the century; he could barely keep up with the demand for his “Korol” (King) brand of seltzer, which he bottled in his barn and delivered to restaurants around the city.)</w:t>

            <w:t>At least that’s what Lev Shenkman thought as he patrolled the streets on a freezing February night. He was the deputy chief of the ward guard, a volunteer neighborhood police force reporting to the city council, and as part of his job he tried to get to know as many people as possible in the town. The city council was comprised of well-respected members of the local intelligentsia, representing an array of predominantly leftist political parties, who had resolved to work together for the benefit of the city. Shenkman recognized that community policing is most effective when the guards and the citizens they are protecting are on familiar terms. Tensions were high throughout Ukraine and had been for years, but on the streets of Proskuriv, on an individual basis, things were fine. Among the ward guards, for instance, Christians and Jews often worked alongside each other, and politics rarely interfered in their joint commitment to keeping the people of Proskuriv safe. Shenkman had no problem working as deputy to Chief Ostkevich-Rudnitskii, a Christian. And while some residents didn’t like the idea of Jews patrolling the streets with weapons, most people were more tolerant and saw the benefits of a guard force that mirrored the ethnic makeup of the city.</w:t>

On February 5, he sent a paramilitary band that called itself the Third Haidamak Regiment, and a Cossack brigade under the command of the 25-year-old former agronomist Ivan Semosenko, to aid Kiverchuk.

They relished their reputation as tough guys who refused to play by the rules, and made it clear that they had little patience for Jews and their legalisms. According to Ilya Joffe, who headed the socialist bloc in the city council, as soon as Semosenko arrived a “pogrom atmosphere” pervaded the city. Others recalled that “people stayed locked in their houses and were afraid to show themselves on the street.”</w:t>

(The rebels had even selected the members of a Military Revolutionary Committee, the police chief asserted.) Joffe shared Shenkman’s skepticism, but also his concern. Late that night, he learned that some of the trade unionists were indeed preparing an imminent seizure of power. Joffe was furious: the socialist bloc was strongly opposed to an uprising and had been working productively with the left-leaning Directory government. As a Jew—like many members of the socialist bloc—Joffe was acutely aware of what had happened to the Jews of Zhytomyr after the Bolsheviks tried and failed to seize power. He blamed the plot on a group of young firebrands, uneducated workers, and criminal elements among the Bolsheviks and their Left SR allies, who, he claimed, lived off money sent from Soviet Russia and acted as Russian agents agitating for the overthrow of Ukrainian independence.</w:t>

They were convinced that once they had attained power in Proskuriv, the revolution would quickly spread back to Zhmerynka. As Alekseev put it, “A Proskuriv uprising would inevitably draw several military units from Zhmerynka to restrain it, and we could use the situation of panic it would create to act in Zhmerynka as well.”</w:t>

The visitors assured Joffe that the insurrection was part of a coordinated action across the province directed from afar. Proskuriv had been selected to be the spark, but the railroad workers of Zhmerynka would immediately follow with a general strike that would bring the province to a halt. Everything had been taken care of; even the soldiers of the local regiments were on board, they assured him. The Military Revolutionary Committee was leaving nothing to chance.</w:t>

But it was a cold February day, and he was wearing his fine fur coat. He was suddenly feeling very self-conscious. Would the fur coat identify him as a member of the bourgeoisie and subject him to arrest? Or, if bandits were roaming the lawless streets, would he become an easy target for robbery and assault?

On the way, they noticed that soldiers were shelling the secondary school on Dvoryanskaya Street, where the Bolsheviks had installed machine guns. Stavinsky, whose apartment was near the school, along the hills where the wealthier residents lived, left Verkhola to check on his family. He then returned to City Hall, having dropped off his children for their safety at a priest’s house on the other side of town.

            <w:t>The soldiers rarely articulated their reasons for targeting Jews, but the statements they made during the killings give some clues. In a few cases, Jews seem to have been targeted for religious reasons. In a house on Sobornaya Street where twenty-one people were massacred, for instance, a survivor reported that “before the murder, the Cossacks demanded that the Jews cross themselves. In the event of a refusal or indecision, they killed with the cry, ‘Die, Jew!’”</w:t>

Leyb Kozovy, who was present, described how the worshippers insisted that they were simple pious Jews at prayer and had no interest in politics. “The soldier near me smiled,” Kozovy recalled, “and drove his bayonet into my neighbor.” Kozovy was wounded in the back and survived by pretending to be dead; all the other worshippers were killed in the attack.

            <w:t>Zemelman had a point. Even if the soldiers truly believed that all adult Jews were tainted with Bolshevik sympathies, they could not have believed that children, let alone babies, were influenced by Marxist-Leninist political ideology. Yet children and babies were still targeted, and often killed with exceptional cruelty. This hatred ran deeper than politics. Khaim Baran testified that his 4-year-old brother, Boris, was impaled upon the bayonet of a soldier.

The pogrom took place within what the Dutch sociologist Abram de Swaan has called a “killing compartment,” a narrowly circumscribed period of time in which ordinary norms are suspended for the purpose of mass destruction against a clearly defined set of victims. It had an explicit starting point and an end point.</w:t>

            <w:t>Yet what really distinguished the crowd that attacked Jews in Proskuriv on February 15 was its eliminationist intent. The pretext of the massacre was the failed coup planned by the Bolsheviks and their Left SR allies, but it was the Jews of the city who suffered the consequences. When Semosenko unleashed his men to wreak havoc in the city, they understood it as a license to attack Jews. The association between Bolsheviks and Jews was already part of the affective disposition of the soldiers, an ingrained part of their world view. Hence, Jewish children could be bayoneted on the charge of Bolshevism, wealthy Jewish businessmen could be seen as radical leftists, and elderly Jewish men could be blamed for an uprising that took place without their knowledge while they were at prayer in synagogue. The fight against Bolshevism, the perpetrators believed, demanded the elimination of the Jews. Indeed, the report Hillerson compiled later that year on the pogrom was prophetic in noting that “beginning with Proskuriv the basic purpose of the pogroms in Ukraine appears to be the total destruction of the Jewish people.”</w:t>

Korosten fell to the Bolsheviks on February 20, and on March 1, the Red Army was in Radomyshl, just fifty miles east of Zhytomyr. The authorities in Zhytomyr began preparing for the possible evacuation of the municipal administration. The city, ostensibly under Directory control, was being patrolled by three separate units: Vozny’s militia; a civilian joint force composed of police and ward guards; and, until they were recalled toward the end of the month, some highly trained Galician riflemen. Additionally, there were quite a few reservists in the city garrison. Vozny’s officers resented the ward guards, accusing them of meddling in the work of law enforcement, and derided them as the “Jewish police.”</w:t>

On their way, the councilors encountered one of Petliura’s lieutenants, who warned them that if there were any Jews among the delegation they would all be in danger. The one Jewish councilor in the group was persuaded to return home. Walking back into town, he came across a body lying on the road: a 70-year-old man with a tallith in his hand had been shot on his way to synagogue. A trail of blood followed the body for several feet, evidence of the mortally wounded man’s futile attempt to get to safety.</w:t>

Mikhlya Volkis, a 28-year-old seamstress, testified that at around seven o’clock in the evening, a gang of eight men dressed in civilian clothes and carrying rifles burst into her apartment, demanded to know if she was hiding any weapons, and proceeded to rummage through her cabinets and trunks.

In the city’s industrial sector, armament and aviation factories replaced boarded-up textile plants; off the coast, Russian battleships patrolled the Black Sea, engaging in cat-and-mouse operations against formidable German cruisers. When the Hetmanate’s military governor, Vassili Biskupsky, was forced to flee to Germany in December 1918, French naval ships stationed in the Black Sea moved in and, in alliance with the Whites, attempted to establish authority in the city to prevent the port from falling to the Bolsheviks. The former commander of White forces in Siberia, Aleksei Grishin-Almazov, a 32-year-old dandy and ladies’ man, was appointed as the new military governor of Odesa. He disbanded existing municipal institutions and tried to rule the city like a dictator, but his ambition and power were tempered by his penchant for boozing and gambling.

Most were French colonial conscripts from northwest Africa, who had little interest in risking their lives fighting for an imperial power so far from Paris, let alone Senegal. Influenced by the French communist press in wide circulation in the city, some came to harbor more sympathy for the anti-colonialist Bolsheviks than for their own French officers. The population at large, however, treated the French with reverence: they controlled the telegraph lines, introduced the first tanks into Ukraine, and were the only officials who seemed able to secure passage on any railway car.

            <w:t>Throughout the winter of 1919, tens of thousands of former landowners, imperial officers, tsarist bureaucrats, and Jewish merchants poured into Odesa from all over the southwestern provinces of the defunct Russian empire, hoping that the French would protect them from the Bolsheviks. The city’s soup kitchens and shelters could hardly keep up with the influx. Under the French tricolor, White officers, Ukrainian nationalists, Greek infantry, Polish cavalry, North African recruits, Zionist poets, Anarchist activists, British businessmen, and all types of profiteers, speculators, and spies mingled along the city’s famed Deribasovskaya Street—Rue de Ribas, to the French. Art, criminality, and the revolution collided in Odesa, as plots were hatched in cabarets while swindlers and charlatans led revolutionary campaigns. Mishka Yaponchik, the “King of Thieves,” ruled over the Moldavanka district, where the lavish banquets he threw for the impoverished Jews turned him into a gangster hero, a role he put to good use by establishing a powerful Jewish self-defense brigade. The prototype of Isaac Babel’s Benya Krik, Yaponchik became a symbol of the chaos and decadence of revolutionary Odesa.</w:t>

In August 1918, he had hatched a plot to detain Trotsky and Lenin and march them through the streets of Moscow ”with their nether garments missing,” as another British spy put it. Better to ridicule them than to make martyrs of them, Reilly had reasoned. The plot was abandoned only when Fanny Kaplan put two bullets into Lenin before the British de-pantsing scheme could be implemented.</w:t>

The Directory was forced yet again to move its headquarters further west, this time to Kamyanets-Podilskyi. Petliura, who had little to show for what his critics characterized as prostrating himself before the imperial powers, found himself embattled politically as well: Borys Martos, the former Minister of Agriculture and the Treasury, formed a new socialist cabinet committed to peace with Bolshevik Russia and an end to foreign assistance from the Entente. But as head of state, Petliura remained the public face of the Ukrainian national movement and retained control of the remnants of his army.

            <w:t>the Bolshevik capture of Odesa, the Allies were increasingly alarmed over the spread of the revolution. Most of Ukraine was in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who ruled the territory from Kharkiv, and the Red Army was rapidly moving toward the Polish borderlands. Margolin blamed the thousands of Russian aristocratic refugees in Paris, who “knew Western European customs and manners of behavior,” for convincing the French to support the Whites rather than the Directory. However, he saw an opening for securing Allied support in Eastern Galicia, where local Ukrainians had proclaimed the West Ukrainian People’s Republic in November 1918 and were now battling Polish forces for control of the region—the last defense against Bolshevik expansion into the European heartland. The West Ukrainian People’s Republic was still loyal to Petliura, and with the seat of the Directory now located in Kamyanets-Podilskyi—closer to Lviv than to Kyiv—Eastern Galicia became the focal point of Petliura’s ambitions. This made Poland his most pressing adversary.</w:t>

            <w:t>Margolin and the rest of the Ukrainian delegation in Paris thus presented their republic as a multinational alternative to the ethnonationalist state emerging in Poland. The Ukrainian principle of national autonomy, they contended, offered a unique solution to the “Jewish Question,” the problem of how best to accommodate Jewish minorities within the European nation-state. Ukraine alone could be trusted to respect the rights of its minorities if the government just had sufficient strength to curtail the ongoing violence. As the second Zhytomyr pogrom raged on the other side of the continent, Hryhory Sydorenko, the head of the delegation, boasted that Ukraine was the first of the new European states to grant complete liberty and equality to Jewish subjects.</w:t>

            <w:t>It may seem inconceivable that many of the leading representatives of world Jewry supported Ukraine after the pogroms of Ovruch, Zhytomyr, and Proskuriv, but outside observers were conflating the atrocities in Ukrainian territory with those in Poland. The geographic distinctions were complicated by the irredentist claims of Jósef Piłsudski and others in the Polish leadership, who considered much of the territory claimed by the Ukrainian People’s Republic to be part of Poland. In the heat of the moment, it was difficult to differentiate exactly under whose authority the violence was occurring. Throughout most of the year, Ukraine was considered too dangerous for foreigners to access, and many governments, including the United States, were refusing to even authorize aid missions; only vague rumors were filtering out of the war zone. It was not until the last days of February that reports of the January pogrom in Zhytomyr had begun to reach London, and even then they were unsubstantiated. And although there was some mention of violence in Proskuriv, the Yiddish press would publish details of the pogrom only when cable dispatches reached them in late May and early June.</w:t>

Vayter). Both incidents, widely covered in the foreign press, further mobilized Jewish public opinion against Poland. In response, the peacemakers in Paris began to take the issue of minority rights more seriously, devoting the last session before their Easter break to the subject. “Good Friday we spent about the Jews,” wrote Sir James Headlam-Morley, a member of the British delegation. “In the old days I believe the right method of spending Good Friday was to massacre the Jews; this custom still prevails in Eastern Europe,” he quipped.</w:t>

Lloyd George suggested that “the Jews had themselves to blame to a considerable extent,” to which Wilson responded that “they were only disloyal in countries where they were not treated properly.” Lloyd George and Clemenceau agreed that in England and France the Jews “were very good citizens,” and, referring to their penchant for commerce (and what he regarded as their monopolistic hold on certain industries), Clemenceau added that “in Poland, a Pole who wanted to carry out any transaction—for example, to buy a horse—would send for a Jew.”</w:t>

He found that despite terrible episodes in the major Polish-controlled cities of Warsaw, Vilnius, and Lviv, the violence in Poland was less widespread than the press and Jewish public opinion had intimated; he was beginning to suspect that the accusations were an “attempt of American Jews to hurt Poland in the eyes of the world,” or even part of a German-Russian plot being orchestrated by the Jews. He recognized that there were instances of Jews being killed in Poland, but in private letters he downplayed the violence. The reality, he proposed in an argument that hardly bolstered his case, was that the situation of the Jews in Poland was no worse than that of the Negroes in the United States.

American Jews were making a big deal out of nothing, he charged. And Polish Jewry would eventually pay for their troublemaking: “If the people in their resentment do rise up and massacre Jews on a scale never before known, the blood guilt will be on the foreign Jews who with wicked disregard of the facts or the danger to human lives have played with this tremendously delicate situation.”</w:t>

            <w:t>Most of the warlords had first tested the waters during the summer of 1918 insurgency against Skoropadskyi and the Germans. Many had some military experience in the Russian imperial army, or later in Petliura’s army, but deserted as the promise of a redistribution of noble land to the peasants faded. Instead they formed militant bands to raid urban centers and take aristocratic estates by force. Often they allied themselves with one or more of the parties claiming authority over Ukraine—the Directory, the Whites, or the Reds—but ultimately clashed with the intelligentsia, autocratic generals, and urban workers whose interests each of the established militaries represented. None of the organized armies were able to excite the countryside as much as the regional warlords did; they shared the villagers’ interests and understood their needs the most.

These peasant bands attacked the heavily Jewish urban centers, often targeting Jewish shops and stores and leaving bodies in their wake. To the peasants they were anti-Bolshevik raids; to the Jewish victims, they were pogroms. Between January and March 1919, approximately one hundred and fifty such incidents took place, but by the summer the number had increased to about ninety each month. One survey counted 148 “pogroms” and “excesses” in the month of May, and 159 in August. Most of these occurred in the province of Kyiv, where the Bolsheviks’ hold was tenuous and stable state power wanting.</w:t>

But, he said, those leaders soon turn against the interests of the working people. The Red Army was the working people’s only true defender. “Guerilla warfare has outlived itself and become a reactionary force. We must put an end to it at any cost,” he concluded, urging the peasants and workers to abandon the insurgency and enlist instead in the Red Army.</w:t>

At the same time, the Commissariat of National Affairs collected and published information on pogroms, documenting 120 pogroms between March and May with an estimated 15,000 fatalities. (These reports deliberately understated the involvement of the Red Army in anti-Jewish violence.) The campaign culminated in August with the establishment of a Committee for the Struggle against Antisemitism within the Commissariat of Enlightenment.

Within a day, the group was forced to retreat as the Reds retook the town. But over the next two weeks, Mitko succeeded in securing the backing of over a thousand men—mostly former soldiers—and procuring nearly two dozen machine guns and two cannons abandoned by the Germans. On March 25, he moved into Radomyshl again. Faced with such a force of arms, the town council turned itself over to Mitko, who declared the establishment of the “Radomyshl Insurgent Republic of Sokolovskyi”—a republic that ruled over the town for all of six days.</w:t>

The priest refuted the accusation, but rumors of an impending Bolshevik attack on the church spread quickly. Mitko, whose supporters may have been responsible for the leaflets in the first place, took advantage of the situation, and barged into the town with a large band of peasant fighters, demanding to know where the rebbe lived. At 6:00 am on Sunday, May 25, they made a beeline for the home of the 57-year-old Avrom Yehoshua Heschl Twersky, better known as the Malyner Rebbe. Ripping off the window shutters, they smashed the windowpanes with their rifle butts and climbed through the broken glass to attack the Hasidic leader. According to a family member’s account of the episode, “The rebbe and his eldest son tried to give them some money and watches and begged them not to disturb anybody in the house. In a minute, a shot rang out and the rebbe fell severely </w:t>

But they are betrayed by their ill-fitting clothes and by their makeshift backdrop, a tattered curtain clumsily tacked onto a wooden batten. In one of the photos, a young man in a papakha sits on a toy horse—a staple of Ukrainian folk art—holding a revolver in his hand, the holster visible at his hip. One of the horse’s legs is broken, forcing the insurgent to hold his foot firmly on the ground to balance himself. The image is comical: the steed resembles My Little Pony more than </w:t>

            <w:t>We know a little more about some of Struk’s men from the files the Cheka created when the Red Army took over the region and began punishing them for banditry. Vasily Boreslavsky, for instance, was born in 1901 in Galicia. He was a drayman by trade, and had served in the military under Kerensky, Skoropadskyi, and Petliura. But he drew the line at the Bolsheviks. Witnesses testified that during his robberies, he refused to take Soviet currency, ripping it up and declaring contemptuously that he didn’t need Jewish money.</w:t>

The captain thought that officials were signaling the ship to come ashore, and brought it in. The insurgents then boarded the ship and again separated the twenty-five Jews on board from the twenty Russians. They took the Jews to shore, robbed them of their valuables, and made them wait together with another group of Jewish prisoners, about forty-five people in total. Several hours later, in the middle of the night, the men led the Jews back onto the deck of the ship. The steamer left the dock, and in the middle of the river the men tossed their captives into the water. Mogulevich recalled, “Everything was still. Suddenly I heard a noise as if a tree trunk were falling into the water. Then my second friend was taken away. Two or three minutes later I heard the same noise.”</w:t>

            <w:t>Jewish community had a small self-defense brigade, which, with the help of Christians from a nearby town, had protected Yustingrad from much of the violence that had engulfed the region during the preceding months. Now, according to the town’s memorial book, the community had become complacent. “It was a beautiful day and the people were relaxing.”</w:t>

Terrified representatives of the Jewish community went door to door to collect money. When they were unable to come up with the funds after two hours, the insurgents took ten men out of the synagogue and shot them, promising to repeat the action every hour. By late afternoon, when it became clear that the ransom was not forthcoming, Zelenyi’s men took the hostages to a bridge on the outskirts of town, shot them all with machine guns</w:t>

His house was on the outskirts of town; the courtyard, which his family shared with his aunt and uncle, adjoined a tannery his parents had acquired as part of his mother’s dowry. Kipnis’s father worked in the tannery, just as his grandfather had. There were two wells in the courtyard, one for the tannery and one for drinking water. The Kipnises also owned a shed and a small room they would occasionally rent out.</w:t>

And he liked Jews. That’s why it was so surprising when on Wednesday, July 16, 1919, Marko helped unleash a massacre of his Jewish neighbors.</w:t>

            <w:t>Like so many local toughs, Marko Lukhtan had been wrenched from rural life and thrown into combat at a young age. His wartime experience had hardened him, and the collapse of the tsarist military in which he fought—not on the battlefield, but due to revolutionary action at home—had convinced him that the army had been betrayed, stabbed in the back. He was drawn home by the Bolshevik promise of land, only to have the fields occupied by the Germans instead. Somehow it seemed that the Jews were behind it all: Trotsky had made the deal with the Germans, and the Jewish sugar barons and grain merchants were profiting from the rising prices of basic goods. Even in Slovechno, the Jews, who made up about half of the town’s two thousand residents, suddenly seemed to be in charge.</w:t>

            <w:t>Melamed, a twenty-four-year-old teacher from Slovechno, the rumors stemmed from the news that the Bolsheviks were preparing to transfer ownership of the metrical books—the official registrar of births, deaths and marriages—from the priest to the soviet executive committee, as they had done in other towns they had conquered. Such a move represented the intrusion of the state into what had long been considered the domain of the church—the personal lives of the common people. It also represented a major diminution of church authority. It was often the Bolsheviks’ attacks on the church that most antagonized the masses, and that contributed to the popular association between Jews and Bolsheviks: many pious Christians could not imagine one of their own profaning the church.

            <w:t xml:space="preserve"> In the evening, a group of prominent Jews went to the police chief to request permission to form a self-defense brigade for the night. The chief assured them that he and his forces had the situation under control. Although the Jewish petitioners were not permitted to patrol the town with weapons, they decided nevertheless to spend the night on guard, roaming the town unarmed just to keep an eye on the tense situation. They were relieved when toward midnight they saw the chief arrive with several men, including Marko Lukhtan and Kosenko, each armed with five rifles slung over their backs. But instead of providing security and distributing the weapons to the Jewish guards, the two men fired off a pair of volleys. At that signal, the town was surrounded by peasants coming out of the darkness. “The police distributed the rifles to the swine and the Jewish guards fled,” writes Kipnis. The polife chief, he says, had planned the whole affair in advance together with Marko Lukhtan and Kosenko.</w:t>

When they met that afternoon in the town square, the rabbi made entreaties for peace, but, according to Melamed, was quickly shouted down. The priest followed the rabbi, condemning bloodshed in general terms, but adding that the Jews deserved whatever was coming to them. The meeting concluded with the Jewish community agreeing to pay a large sum of money, ostensibly to reimburse the peasants for the destruction of the previous days. The Jewish community then held a meeting of its own in the synagogue and collected forty thousand rubles, which it turned over to Kosenko and his men in exchange for a commitment to stop the violence.</w:t>

Jewish geese spoil the wheat fields.” Stodot continues his accusations, claiming that the Jews aided the Germans during the war and are now communists. Marko Lukhtan then steps in and demands that the Jews give up their money in order to put an end to the bloodshed.

On the street outside, the peasants unleashed another wave of fire, killing and wounding many more until the shooting died down at daybreak. A total of twenty-five people were reportedly killed around Ratner’s house, including Ratner’s daughter-in-law Yokheved.</w:t>

            <w:t>On Saturday, June 28, 1919—five years to the day since Gavrilo Princip’s fateful assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand—lancers in blue uniforms and tin hats lined the square in front of the Chateau Versailles as motor cars ferried Clemenceau, Wilson, Lloyd George, and their aides into the palace. Escorted by the French Republican Guard, Clemenceau, the host, led the stately convoy up the Grand Staircase, through the state rooms, and into the Galerie des Glaces, the same place where Bismarck had declared the establishment of the German Empire back in 1871. Now, the leaders of the Great Powers sat on a slightly elevated dais in the middle of the magnificent room, surrounded by gilded bronze capitals, red marble “Rouge de Rance” pilasters, and hundreds of mirrors. A throng of distinguished guests—sixty people for each of the Great Powers—looked on. There were no elaborate speeches; the mood was subdued.

When Paderewski announced he would welcome such a commission, the matter was settled. US Secretary of State Robert Lansing charged the commission with investigating “the various massacres, pogroms, and other excesses alleged to have taken place,” for the purpose of “seeking to discover the reason lying behind such excesses and discriminations with a view to finding a possible remedy.”</w:t>

But as a staunch assimilationist and an outspoken opponent of Zionism, Morgenthau had few friends among Jewish activists. He was one of the signers of a declaration sent to President Wilson which contended that Zionism “not only misinterprets the trend of the history of the Jews, who ceased to be a nation 2,000 years ago, but involves the limitation and possible annulment of the larger claims of Jews for full citizenship and human rights in all lands in which those rights are not yet secure.”</w:t>

In the midst of the dinner, Lansing and Paderewski left to bid farewell to President Wilson, who was boarding the train to Le Havre for his return to America. Morgenthau was left alone at the table with Dmowski. Expressions of antisemitism were still acceptable in polite society, so it was not shocking when Morgenthau turned to Dmowski and said, “I understand that you are an Anti-Semite, and I want to know how you feel toward our commission.” Far from denying the characterization, Dmowski replied, “My Anti-Semitism isn’t religious: it is political.” He assured Morgenthau that he had no quarrel with Jews, so long as they were not in Poland. “He wanted Poland for the Poles alone—and made no secret of this desire,” recalled Morgenthau. “There never was a pogrom in Poland,” Dmowski insisted, taking the position that the violence in Lviv, Pinsk, and elsewhere were brawls rather than massacres. Before the ink on the Polish Minorities Treaty was even dry, Dmowski gave Morgenthau a dire warning: “Unless the Jews would abandon their exclusiveness, they had better leave the country.”</w:t>

He was joined now by more disciplined Galician soldiers from the defunct Western Ukrainian People’s Republic, who came under his command following the Polish occupation of Eastern Galicia. As Petliura’s forces fought their way back from Kamyanets-Podilskyi, heading toward Uman, the Whites advanced through Elizavetgrad, a hundred miles to the east. Both armies were converging on Bolshevik-held Kyiv. Petliura had sent signals to the Whites suggesting an alliance, a position favored by the British and French, who saw a joint Ukrainian-Russian advance against the Bolsheviks as the best chance for defeating the Red Army. But Denikin was not interested in cooperating with Petliura, whose Ukrainian Republic infringed upon his dream of a united Russia. Nevertheless, Petliura ordered his soldiers to avoid conflict </w:t>

            <w:t>The fires began on Monday evening. According to Yona Leichenko, the first victim was Aba Markman: Cossacks filled his house with gunpowder, doused it with kerosene, and set it alight. Soon, the homes of Perets Feldman, Yakov Zabolotsky, Motel Shlak, Dovid Neishtat, Aron Mestechkin, Eliezer-Dovid Feldman, Yosef Kogan and many others were also set on fire with incendiary bombs. The fire easily devoured the houses, with their thatched roofs and walls made of clay and straw over wooden frames. By daybreak, the entire Jewish quarter, where merchants lived behind their storefronts, was in flames. The systematic torching of houses represented an escalation in the violence and the level of hostility: the conflagration rendered the damage irrevocable, transforming the physical landscape of the town center into ash and embers, a warning to the inhabitants never to return.</w:t>

The Bolsheviks, who had controlled the government since February, were equally disliked.

            <w:t>The Red Army launched another major counteroffensive against both Petliura and Denikin in December. Petliura’s army once again evaporated into the countryside and, on December 5, 1919, the Chief Otaman himself fled to Warsaw to seek new alliances within Poland. The Whites were forced into a retreat, leaving the Ukrainian heartland as quickly as they came. The Bolsheviks entered Kyiv on Thursday, December 11. “The city wasn’t bombed,” recalled one resident, “but we could hear the crackling of the machine guns and the cannonade from the armored trains.”</w:t>

The soldiers turned to Sery’s father and beat him, yelling all the while: “Jews, money!” Sery’s father offered some money, but the Cossacks were not satisfied, and they struck him in the face.

Thanks to Chaykovsky’s insider information, Kuravskyi and his men were able to quickly get past the guards at Vynnychenko’s headquarters, where they opened fire. One insurgent, who some witnesses identified as Oleksandr Sahatyuk, threw a grenade toward the building; unfortunately for Sahatyuk, it rebounded off the window frame and blinded him in the blast. Vynnychenko’s men easily captured him. When residents awoke on Wednesday morning, Sahatyuk’s limp body was hanging from a noose slung over Vynnychenko’s balcony; evidence of the tortures he had endured was displayed for all to see.</w:t>

As he got to work dousing the embers with water, an insurgent approached his yard and ordered him to “go tell the Jews to bury their dead.” The man then walked into the house, stabbed Ispo’s wife, Shifre, with a stake, and proceeded to take their last possessions from the charred cupboards. After he left, Ispo took his wounded wife to a neighboring cellar, where he hoped he could hide her from further harm. As he opened the cellar door, he saw twelve dead bodies. He laid his wounded wife among them.</w:t>

            <w:t>On June 27, 1920, three months after the pogrom, while travelling with some companions by cart, Vassili Perevalov was stopped on the road from Bila Tserkva to Kyiv by Bolshevik special agents, who had been tipped off that Perevalov was responsible for the Tetiiv pogrom. Perevalov insisted that he was just a poor peasant bringing farm products to starving relatives in Kyiv; in these times of scarcity, countryfolk needed to help out their city kin. The story was plausible, but the special agents had good reason to doubt it. Their informant was Volf Lederman, the former Bolshevik leader of Tetiiv. The special agents searched through Perevalov’s freight and found about a hundred and fifty pounds of millet, fifteen pounds of sugar, and ten pounds of lard—nothing unusual for peasants bringing their goods to market. But then they discovered a pouch containing two hundred thousand rubles. They confiscated the money and brought the group to Bila Tserkva for further questioning.</w:t>

He could even name them: Leyzer Shvarts, Moyshe Peker and two of his sons, Shleym Grosman and his two daughters, and others as well. But when asked if they were still alive, Perevalov was at a loss. He had heard that Leyzer Shvarts was living in Kyiv, but he didn’t know the fate of the others. A medic who served as a witness in the case suggested the answer: “He apparently turned them over to the bandits, who carried out the bloody massacre.”</w:t>

            <w:t>In April 1920, Polish and Ukrainian forces advanced toward Kyiv from the north, beginning what came to be known as the Polish-Soviet War. Their goal was to challenge Bolshevik ascendency in the region and reclaim the historic lands of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Petliura, who was then in exile in Warsaw, had agreed to an alliance with Piłsudski in which Poland would support Ukrainian independence in the provinces of the former Russian Empire in exchange for Petliura’s renunciation of Ukrainian claims to Eastern Galicia.</w:t>

Polish soldiers were amazed at the bedraggled appearance of the Bolsheviks. “Some were barefoot, some had shabby soft shoes, others had rubber galoshes,” wrote Franciszek Krzystyniak, “while on their heads they wore a variety of headgear—some even had women’s hats—and winter caps or kerchiefs, and some were even bareheaded, their hair flying in the wind.

Polish officer Mieszysław Lepecki recalled that “the people of Zhytomyr, fed on falsehoods about Poland and the Polish Army put about by Soviet sources, thought that our units were some sort of marauding bands, dressed in tatters and living off requisitions.

Bulak-Balachowicz was a veteran of the tsarist army who had commanded a cavalry division on behalf first of the Reds and then the Whites, and had gained notoriety for his penchant for hanging suspected communists from lampposts. “I don’t fight for the tsar, I don’t fight for the Russian manors; but for the land, bread and for all people,” he had declared in one manifesto.</w:t>

            <w:t>The Bolsheviks, for their part, were convinced that an imminent worker revolution in Poland would render any agreement irrelevant, and so regarded all territorial concessions as provisional. Negotiations began in Minsk and continued in Riga, where on March 18, 1921, the Bolsheviks formally renounced their claims to Eastern Galicia and permitted Poland to retain its hold over Vilnius. The border between Poland and Ukraine was set along the Zbrucz River. Proskuriv and Kamyanets-Podilskyi were incorporated into Soviet Ukraine; Minsk into Soviet Byelorussia; and Rivne and Pinsk into the Polish Republic. The treaty also stipulated that individuals living in territories granted to the Soviet states who could claim historic ties to Poland might opt for Polish citizenship and be repatriated. By the fall of 1921, over 300,000 people—POWs, hostages, civilian prisoners, and refugees—had left Soviet territories for Poland. The war was over, but a global refugee crisis was just beginning.</w:t>

            <w:t>The Peace of Riga ended major military conflicts, but the impact of the violence continued with massive population displacement. New tensions emerged as hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees arrived in European capitals, claiming to be fleeing “Ukrainian Cossacks,” while at the same time similar numbers of Ukrainians showed up claiming to be fleeing “Jewish Bolsheviks.” The westward migration of poverty-stricken Eastern European Jewish refugees had begun even before the Great War, but the civil war increased the flow and stigmatized the newcomers as dangerous Bolsheviks intent on spreading revolution. At the same time, the pogroms alienated Jews from the Ukrainian cause to which many had once contributed, and led them instead to turn to the new Soviet bureaucracy for justice and protection. The association between Jews and Bolsheviks became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</w:t>

            <w:t>In the fall of 1921, as the Bolsheviks consolidated their control over the lands once claimed by the Ukrainian People’s Republic, the newly renamed Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was suffering from famine, disease, and political turmoil. Poor crop yields were exacerbated by Bolshevik requisitions, which transferred food reserves and grain from the previous year’s harvest to the Russian interior and had discouraged farmers from planting surplus seed.

As Jews abandoned the towns and villages they had called home for generations and sought shelter instead in larger cities, the needy could no longer rely on the local networks of support that had sustained them through difficult times in the past. Tetiiv, for instance, which had once hosted a small but thriving Jewish community, was completely ethnically cleansed, while some twenty thousand Jewish refugees, 6,500 of them children, were living in makeshift dormitories in the basements of synagogues in Uman. Similarly, fifty thousand Jewish refugees had fled to Odesa.</w:t>

After being naturalized as an American citizen in 1904, the Moscow-born educator had given up his job as principal of a trade school in New Jersey to work on behalf of refugee relief, eventually becoming director of the Joint and moving to Warsaw as General Director of the committee’s relief operations in Europe.

            <w:t>suffering, he was still taken aback when he arrived in Ukraine in 1922 as part of the American Relief Administration. In an orphanage in Proskuriv, he observed “boys and girls crowded together in a heap of tatters on the floor without any clothing wherewith to cover their bodies. They could not step beyond the threshold, for they had nothing to put on. They could not move, for there was no free space. All looked extremely emaciated, some of them like skeletons. That was a terrible sight.” Scarlet fever and typhus ran rampant as the sick lay on the ground covered in filthy rags, infecting their healthier neighbors; there was insufficient clothing, underwear, mattresses, and blankets.</w:t>

            <w:t>As Bogen noted, the dislocation, suffering, and trauma was having a deep psychological impact likely to outlast any physical wounds. It was a threat recognized by other aid workers as well. The Federation of Ukrainian Jews, a London-based relief committee, predicted as early as 1919 that the violence the refugees had witnessed as children would shape future generations: “Starving children are always the potential parents of discontented and anti-social men and women. But the demoralized urchins from the Ukraine, with their childish memory of seeing a father shot or a mother violated by savage soldiery, present a problem beyond the reach of ordinary methods of relief. Such children seem bound to grow up with a grievance against society, unless a remedy is found for their moral as well as their physical wants.”</w:t>

The pogroms of the preceding years, which had been justified on the specious grounds that Jews were responsible for Bolshevism, were having the paradoxical effect of driving Jews toward Soviet power, where Jewish ethnicity posed few barriers to advancement.</w:t>

The influx of Jews seeking admission led to anti-Jewish student demonstrations, organized by radical nationalists who accused the Jews of importing Bolshevism and corrupting the student body. In December 1922, a nationwide general strike demanded a quota on Jewish admission to the university, and throughout the year the right-wing press stoked xenophobia and warned of the racial corruption of Romania. In the midst of this climate of hyper-nationalism, Romania reluctantly adopted a constitution that granted citizenship for Jews, in accordance with the minority treaties signed in Paris. But an administrative rule required that applicants for naturalization demonstrate continued residence in Romania since before the Great War, an impossibility for the eighty thousand Jewish refugees then living in the country.</w:t>

Large segments of the Arab population responded to the migration movement and the British Mandate with suspicion and anger that occasionally erupted into riots and violence. Although it was more of a reaction to Zionist ambitions than fears of racial or political contamination, many Jewish leaders and migrants interpreted Arab hostility as another version of what they had experienced in Europe. In March 1920 skirmishes between Jewish paramilitaries and Arab militias in the disputed region of the Upper Galilee led to the death of Joseph Trumpeldor, a veteran of the Russo-Japanese war who had inspired Jewish self-defense movements in Ukraine. His death at the settlement of Tel Hai initiated a virtual cult within the Zionist movement and amplified his call for Jewish self-defense. Even a Ukrainian nationalist like Margolin could agree: “Of course, it is better to die by an Arab’s knife in one’s ancestral land than to become a victim of a pogrom in Ukraine or Poland,” he wrote from Germany.</w:t>

            <w:t>Throughout the spring of 1926, Yiddish poet and watchmaker Sholem Schwarzbard wandered through the streets of Paris’s Latin Quarter with a pistol in his pocket. In his hands he carried two photos of Petliura, one cut out from the Larousse Encyclopedia, and another he had found in a recent newspaper from which he learned that the former chief otaman was living in the French capital. Schwarzbard was obsessed. The 40-year old, who courtroom reporters would later comment looked “more like a clerk than a murderer,” short, blond, and “undistinguished in appearance,” drew no attention to himself as he sought out Petliura from among the crowds, comparing the features of likely candidates to the photo in his hands.</w:t>

            <w:t>Born in 1886 in Bessarabia, Schwarzbard was raised in the Podilian town of Balta. Three of his siblings and his mother died when he was a child; the young Schwarzbard was apprenticed to a watchmaker soon after his bar mitzvah. As a youth, he became involved in anarchist circles, agitating for the overthrow of the tsar. Once, in 1906, when he was distributing literature inside a synagogue, the pious Jews trying to pray got fed up with him and denounced him to the authorities. He was detained, but managed to flee across the Austro-Hungarian border, and continued his anarchist activities. He was arrested again in Vienna on the charge of robbing a small wine bar. The barkeep found him on the premises at opening time: the would-be thief had carelessly locked himself inside at closing the night before. The till was short and Schwarzbard was carrying a tool kit and cash. Undeterred by the hopelessness of his defense, the brash poet claimed it was a case of misidentification. After serving four months for the crime, he moved to Budapest, where he again found himself in custody, this time for distributing radical literature. He relocated to Paris in 1910, where during the Great War he served in the Foreign Legion and later in a regular French infantry brigade. He was injured and awarded the Croix de Guerre.</w:t>

Upon hearing news of the overthrow of the tsar in Russia, Schwarzbard returned to Ukraine in the summer of 1917, just in time to witness the chaos of the civil war. He floated through several revolutionary fighting brigades, eventually finding his way to French-occupied Odesa. Soon after Grigoriev’s conquest of the city, Schwarzbard joined the Bolsheviks and traveled with a </w:t>

Disillusioned and traumatized, he returned to Paris, where, under the pen name of Bal-Khaloymes (“The Dreamer”), he published vignettes about the pogroms and a series of poems about the war. For his day job, he got work fixing clocks in a small shop, and resigned himself to a quiet life. At least until he found the photo of Petliura in the Larousse.</w:t>

            <w:t>The Ukrainian diaspora community, on the other hand, united around Petliura, collecting some four hundred statements to present at trial defending their leader’s honor. Since most of the Ukrainian territories Petliura had once ruled were now under Soviet control, with free speech restricted and nationalist sentiment shunned, the Ukrainian diaspora in Paris, Vienna, Berlin, and Prague became the chief voice of the Ukrainian independence movement. Petliura, who had previously been a controversial figure among Ukrainian nationalists, many of whom blamed him for the ultimate failure of the movement and particularly for his surrender of Eastern Galicia to Poland, was celebrated in death as a national hero. At a memorial service for the slain leader, his former political rivals interpreted his murder as an attack “not on Petliura the person” but on “the cause he served.”</w:t>

Both the prosecution and defense assembled hundreds of witnesses from around the world, each of whom advanced their own narrative to account for what had happened in Ukraine just a few years earlier. The trial preparations provided the opportunity for a communal reckoning. One of the most insightful assessments was provided by former prime minister Volodymyr Vynnychenko, who sent in a testimony blaming the “enemies of an independent Ukraine” for promoting the idea that “the people of Ukraine are only a people of barbarians, bandits, and pogrom perpetrators.” These propagandists, he continued, are depriving Ukrainians “not only of </w:t>

He too noted the psychological impact of war on Ukrainian soldiers, but emphasized that “many of these men had been forcibly mobilized by the Red Army, where they had been compelled to serve under Jewish commanders, who marched them against their own people.” Martos blamed the revolutionary tribunals for being overzealous in executing Ukrainian peasants for alleged counterrevolutionary activity, and claimed that two-thirds of the members of those tribunals were Jews. “Is there any force that could satiate the desire for revenge?” he asked, excusing the pogroms as an understandable reaction to Jewish oppression.</w:t>

            <w:t>In the months following Schwarzbard’s acquittal, many of the Jewish activists who had been his staunchest defenders came to reflect upon the impact the trial was likely to have on the Jews who remained in Ukraine and their non-Jewish neighbors. The trial had dredged up animosities between the two communities that would be difficult to heal. Whereas Petliura had been a controversial figure for both Ukrainian and Jewish observers before his death, his assassination had opened an unbridgeable chasm between the two sides. Petliura had become a hero to all Ukrainians and an archetypal villain to the Jews—a precursor to Hitler, as some would later put it. Schwarzbard, by contrast, had become a hero to the Jews and a villain to Ukrainians. “This trial is a catastrophe, a catastrophe for Jewish-Ukrainian relations,” wrote Shulhyn to Margolin when it was all over.</w:t>

The flourishing of Yiddish culture even prompted some of the Ukrainian Jewish intellectuals who had constituted the heart of the Berlin diaspora to return, as the city of Kyiv emerged as a major center of Yiddish life. In the economic sphere, many Jewish artisans whose cottage industries were frowned upon by the state found employment instead in the growing factories, where they worked on production lines alongside Christian laborers. The migration of Jews into larger cities shattered the tight-knit communities that had kept Jews to themselves in small towns and villages. Jewish integration was a cornerstone of Soviet policy in Ukraine.</w:t>

Political commissars were given wide latitude to shoot peasants on the spot if they were suspected of harboring a bandit or concealing weapons. Throughout Ukraine, regional divisions of the Cheka hunted for bandits, uncovered “Petliurite plots,” and arrested or shot peasant leaders who had engaged in “counterrevolutionary” activity during the civil war. Villagers were coerced </w:t>

Jewish victims of pogroms quickly learned to call the perpetrators “bandits” in order to provoke a government response.</w:t>

            <w:t>Although most Jews had initially joined to combat pogroms and prosecute perpetrators, many remained in the secret police once new campaigns were initiated. In the summer and fall of 1927, when the state was arresting “anti-Soviet elements” and forcibly requisitioning grain in Ukraine, many peasants noted the presence of Jews among the activists. Far fewer noticed the number of Jews being arrested as speculators, private traders, and Zionists. The following year, Stalin declared his first Five Year Plan and began a drive to collectivize agriculture by seizing land from private homesteads and turning it over to state institutions. Twenty-five thousand urban workers and intelligentsia specifically recruited for the project fell upon the countryside to convince peasants to give up their land and join collectives. The Thousanders, as they were known, did not shy away from the use of force in persuading the peasants to comply. Many, like Gershon Shapiro and Lev Kopelev, came from Jewish backgrounds and had first tested their fighting chops defending the towns and villages of Ukraine from pogrom perpetrators.</w:t>

            <w:t>In 1929 alone ten to fifteen thousand peasant families were arrested and shipped in freight cars thousands of miles away, to Siberia or Central Asia, where they were left to fend for themselves in “special settlements,” often no more than tents set up outside a railway station. The peasants responded as they had to the Red Terror in 1919—with thousands of mass protests and disturbances. The Soviet secret police fought back with the language of the civil war, accusing the peasants of banditry and Petliurism as though their resistance was premised on a nationalist agenda as opposed to simple survival.</w:t>

The produce was sent to Odesa, where longshoremen loaded it onto ships for export in exchange for the hard currency Stalin needed to fuel his military and industrialization drive.

            <w:t>The famine was worst in the countryside. In the cities, where most of the Jews lived, workers continued to receive rations, albeit just above starvation level, and special stores remained open for those with access to foreign currency. Jews suffered terribly during the famine, and thousands if not tens of thousands perished. But the Ukrainian peasants bore the brunt of it. In subsequent years, some would recall the generosity of their Jewish neighbors who shared what little food they had. Others would remember only that when Ukrainian peasants were starving to death, the urban Jews seemed to somehow have food. Many imagined that it had something to do with the presence of Jews in the upper echelons of government, or blamed Jews for speculating in stolen grain.</w:t>

In conjunction with the Joint and its subsidiary, the American Jewish Joint Agricultural Corporation (known as Agro-Joint), Rosen helped raise money in the United States to fund the settlement of three thousand Jewish families per year in the Ukrainian south and Crimea. He even gained financial support from Julius Rosenwald, Felix Warburg, and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Rosen sold the plan not just as a solution to the Jewish refugee problem, but as a panacea for the predicament of world Jewry. Like the Zionists who were establishing agricultural settlements in Palestine, Rosen believed that by training Jews to become agricultural workers, he could forever remove the stigma of Jews as petty traders, peddlers, and moneylenders. Herbert Hoover agreed, characterizing the endeavor as “one of the outstanding pieces of human engineering in the world today.”</w:t>

As Bolshevik city folk with their pince-nez glasses and goatees raided churches and monasteries for the benefit of industrial and military production, many peasants and townspeople were reminded of the proclamations and leaflets they had read a decade earlier warning that with a Bolshevik victory, the Jews would steal their land and close their churches.</w:t>

            <w:t>and Ukrainians also faced a turbulent decade. Despite the rights promised to ethnic minorities in the treaties signed in Paris, the National Democratic (Endek) government elected in Poland in 1922 failed to provide state funding for Jewish schools or to protect observance of the Jewish Sabbath. It also closed down Ulkrainian cultural institutions and persecuted the Ukrainian minority. Instead, the Endeks promoted a Polish identity based on the Roman Catholic church with little tolerance for ethnic or religious minorities. Electoral gerrymandering ensured that Eastern Galicia, where Poland’s largest minorities of Jews and Ukrainians were concentrated, was allocated fewer seats than its population warranted. Only in May 1926 did Piłsudski’s coup d’état bring to power a more moderate and inclusive government, allowing for a flourishing of cultural, political, and religious life for both minorities. But ethnic and religious tensions continued to run deep, and further deteriorated with Piłsudski’s death in 1935 and the return of right-wing nationalists to power. As fascism swept through Europe, the Polish government too promoted xenophobic policies aimed at excluding Jews from public life, including segregated seating in university lecture halls, boycotts of Jewish businesses, and discriminatory economic policies. Many Jews responded by leaving Poland altogether: nearly ten percent of the Jewish population</w:t>

            <w:t>Eastern Byelorussia, and the city of Vilnius, in September 1939, two weeks after the German invasion of Poland and the start of World War II. A month earlier, Nazi Germany had concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union that stipulated the division of Poland between the two powers. The collapse of their state was experienced as a disaster for the Polish majority, but Ukrainians and Jews saw it differently. Most Jews were relieved to be conquered by the Reds rather than by the Nazis. Some were also pleasantly surprised to meet Jews among the Red Army soldiers. “A couple of them were Jewish,” recalled Simon Feldman in a 1997 interview he recorded with the Shoah Foundation. “They got off and were talking to my grandmother and my aunts. They were dressed neat, the Russian soldiers. And they were Jews. I mean, that was really unique.”</w:t>

But both Ukrainians and Jews soon found themselves victims of the new Soviet regime. Throughout the conquered territory, the Bolsheviks authorized violence against those they identified as counter-revolutionaries, inflaming ethnic tensions and providing opportunities for revenge killings and settling of old scores.</w:t>

And it was kind of unusual to have a Jew that would be involved in that.” The Soviet regime removed all the restrictions the Polish government had placed on the Jews. Edward Spicer, a former resident of Lviv who was interviewed by the Shoah Foundation in 1996, recalled: “In the polytechnical schools, we had a quota, only so many Jews could get into the school. But when the Russians came to town, all of a sudden the doors opened wide and before you know, about half the students were Jews.”</w:t>

            <w:t>The mass murder of Jews resumed in the days and weeks after the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941, this time with yet a new set of perpetrators—the Nazis and their collaborators. In Ukraine, which was still reeling from the bloodshed of the pogroms and the retaliatory violence that followed it, over five hundred thousand Jews were killed in the first six months of war. By the fall of 1943, the death toll approached 1.4 million, about a quarter of the total number of Jewish victims of the Holocaust. The vast majority were murdered with bullets, at close range, near their homes, while their neighbors watched, assisted, and sometimes pulled the trigger before plundering their property and even moving into their homes. Survivors called these massacres “pogroms”; they were lethal, participatory, and familiar. In contrast to the systematized and unprecedented killing operation the Germans would perfect in the death camps they later established in occupied Poland, these first mass killings of the Holocaust were vast escalations of a known phenomenon. By 1941, the population had come to recognize the singling out and slaughter of Jews as an ordinary part of warfare. Combined with Nazi racial ideology, fascist violence, colonial expansion, and the myth of “Judeo-Bolshevism,” this normalization of mass murder emboldened the Germans in their genocidal ambitions.</w:t>

In the weeks leading up to the invasion, Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi ideologue whom Hitler placed in charge of the occupied territories in the east, had proposed giving locals a “free hand” to deal with the “Jewish Question,” and Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Reich Security Main Office, instructed his commanders on June 29 “not to hinder the attempts of local anti-communist and anti-Jewish circles in the newly-occupied territories to engage in cleansing activities. On the contrary, they should be carried out and intensified, if necessary, and channeled in the right direction, but without leaving a trace.”</w:t>

It entered the city on June 30 together with volunteer expeditionary units composed of ethnic Ukrainians from the diaspora, whose formation Bandera had encouraged imagining they would comprise the nucleus of a Ukrainian national army. Over the following days, these militiamen would carry out a massive pogrom against the Jewish population, leaving between two to five thousand Jews dead.</w:t>

There, they discovered the bodies of some three thousand Ukrainians, Poles, and Jews whom the retreating Soviet secret police had executed.

            <w:t>Film footage recorded by the Germans that US forces discovered after the war and exhibited during the Nuremberg Trials documents what happened next. It includes some of the most disturbing images of the Holocaust, essentially a massacre in process. The grainy silent film begins with scenes of dying men on the pavement. Then, a woman—stark naked—is marched past the camera through a crowded and chaotic street under the direction of a uniformed man. Another man in a bowler hat swings his arm back, and with full force brings a rod or cane down upon the exposed buttocks of the woman. She starts to walk faster as her hand clutches her bruised behind. Another naked man runs past. Crowds are watching; some seem to be enjoying the scene. Others are milling about. In the next scene, a man is dragging a woman through the streets by her hair. Later in the film, lines of people under guard are being marched through the street as crowds look on from the sidewalks.</w:t>

On July 5, they arrested Bandera in Kraków and, a few days later, detained Stetsko as well, transporting both to Berlin. Keeping the territory under their own control, the Germans established auxiliary police drawn from the local population, at first by seeking out volunteers, later through compulsion.

He recalled that when the Germans occupied the town, the whole population “gathered at the station out of curiosity.” It was then that “the German officer addressed the people and said that we need to appoint an elder, a person to maintain order. Someone shouted—’Here’s a White emigrant. He served in Denikin’s army. Let’s make him commandant.’ At the time, I was a little drunk and I stepped forward.

In 1932 he was arrested for failing to meet his bread production quota. His previous service in Petliura’s army was an aggravating factor that led to his sentence of eight years in exile. By 1941, he had ample reason to despise the Bolsheviks, and tried to rile up prospective recruits by portraying the current war as a continuation of the civil war: “We need to volunteer for the German army, to fight the Soviets as I fought for Petliura in 1918,” Grabar said, according to a witness (Grabar himself disputed this statement in questioning). In December 1941, Grabar joined the regional police of Khonkivtsi, and served in that capacity until the arrival of the Red Army in March 1944.</w:t>

            <w:t>In late July and early August 1941, SS Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler toured the newly conquered territories in Ukraine and summoned commanders to meet directly with him. After these visits, the Germans began to quash local initiatives and establish more complete control. It was a policy that made sense in areas that had been under Russian control since tsarist times, and where local resistance to the Germans was more intense. The killings also increased dramatically. Although there are no records of a written order—the Nazis rarely put such orders in writing—some have come to see this as a key turning point in the Holocaust. Himmler may have endorsed or even ordered the murder of entire Jewish communities—men, women and children—escalating the previous policy of singling out mostly men.</w:t>

            <w:t>physical extermination of the Jewish population need not remain a utopian fantasy, but could actually be realized. As if to confirm that a new era had dawned, on August 19, Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels recorded in his diary a conversation with Hitler: “We also spoke about the Jewish problem. The Führer is of the conviction that his earlier prophesy in the Reichstag, that if the Jews succeeded in provoking a world war once again, it would end with the extermination of the Jews—was coming true.”</w:t>

All these actions lent legitimacy and a sense of normalcy to the mass murders.

In late August and September, Ukrainian police went door to door to enforce the regulations and to select Jews for forced labor. Unenlisted locals, often Ukrainian teenagers or even children, were provided with rolls of barbed wire and gloves to fence in the ghettos. In Proskuriv, for instance, Blekhman recalled that “the Germans ordered all the Jews in town to assemble together in one place, a ghetto.” Local Ukrainian police oversaw the roundup and “whoever didn’t move into the ghetto would be shot on the street.” The ghetto was surrounded by barbed wire and was guarded by at most “maybe one or maybe two Germans; the rest were Ukrainian gendarmes or police.” She recalled that all the Jews were ordered to wear a yellow star and were used as forced labor to harvest the </w:t>

Similarly, the Germans set off a few streets in Korostyshiv, Radomyshl, Fastiv, Chernobyl, and hundreds of other cities, towns, and villages. On August 26, about fifteen thousand Jews were confined to a ghetto in Berdychiv, the largest in the region. The Germans relied upon locals to help enforce their rules by disclosing Jews in hiding and reporting on suspicious individuals. Some heroically resisted, saving and hiding their neighbors; many others did not.</w:t>

They forced them to bring all their valuables, then they forced them to dance and to laugh, and so on. They beat to death those who refused.”</w:t>

Most were women, children, or elderly people, the able-bodied men having been mobilized into the Red Army over the preceding three months. From the assembly point, the multitude was marched under guard through a barbed wire enclosure, where German soldiers, German military police, and Ukrainian auxiliary police—about three hundred of whom had been recruited from thousands of volunteers at a prisoner of war camp near Zhytomyr—robbed them of all their belongings, money, and documents. They were then led into an open meadow, part of the Babyn Yar system of ravines, where estuaries that once fed into a tributary of the Dnipro river had left steep troughs amidst the lowland fields. Genia Batashova remembered: “On the opposite side of the meadow, surrounded on all sides by Germans, there was a mound of earth. Behind it machine guns clattered away relentlessly. Passageways in the mound were dug out at an acute angle, so that no one could see what was going on past that point. Here on the green square, people’s clothing and underwear were torn off and, beaten with clubs, they were driven toward the passageways.”</w:t>

The local militias who had initiated the revenge killings were quickly sidelined by the heavily armed German Einsatzgruppen. By late 1941, buoyed by their success in the Ukrainian operations, the Germans began experimenting with gas vans in Kharkiv and Poltava, utilizing technologies developed earlier as part of the Nazi euthanasia program. By December 1941, close to one million Jews had been murdered in the newly occupied regions, about a third of the prewar Jewish population. Most of those still alive by the end of the year would perish in ghettos, labor brigades, and camps over the winter, or be murdered in another round of mass shootings when the remaining ghettos were liquidated in the spring of 1942, just as most of the Nazi death camps began functioning to the west. The largest death tolls in Ukraine were recorded in the regions that had once been the Russian provinces of Kyiv, Podilia, and Volhynia, as well as the Austrian province of Galicia, the very same places that suffered most during the pogroms of the civil war. </w:t>

The Holocaust, like all history, was unpredictable. But its broad outlines were anticipated. There were many individuals who tried to take action and prepare for what they feared would be a cataclysmic massacre of the Jewish population in Poland and Ukraine.

Most importantly, the value of Jewish life had been debased. The repercussions of the 1918–21 pogroms continued to linger and ripple through the community.</w:t>

In Soviet Ukraine, on the other hand, the hammer and sickle had dampened ethnic tensions, but the arrival of a new group of soldiers in town soon triggered responses learned during traumatic childhoods and reignited the cycle of violence. As children, many locals had seen Bolshevik investigators, a disproportionate number of whom were Jewish, arrest and execute their heroes—the brash adventurists and “noble bandits” who rose up in defense of a peasant republic and the redistribution of land to the people who worked it. Some had even seen their parents charged with banditry and counterrevolutionary activity.
